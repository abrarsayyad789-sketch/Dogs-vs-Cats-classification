# Dogs-vs-Cats-classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either Dog or Cat. The model is trained on an image dataset and learns to automatically extract important visual features such as edges, textures, and shapes to perform accurate image classification.

The objective of this project is to understand how Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques can be used to solve real-world image recognition problems.
